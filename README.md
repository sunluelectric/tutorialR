My special thanks goes to YouTube channel [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) video titled [R Programming Tutorial - Learn the Basics of Statistical Computing](https://youtu.be/_V8eKsto3Ug), as that is where my journey on R started.

My special thanks goes to Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund for their book _R for Data Science_. I found the book on Amazon at first, then borrowed the digital version of the book from the university library (yes I am a research staff in a university). Then from the introduction section of the book, I quote:
"An online version of this book is available at [http://r4ds.had.co.nz](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) It will continue to evolve in between reprints of the physical book." What can I say. It is a fantastic book and we need to thank the authors for their kind and generosity. I think I will purchase a hard copy of the book as a souvenir for the delightful journey of learning R and R-Studio eventually.
