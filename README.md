# tutorialR
The tutorials provide codes and samples for beginners (like myself) to learn R and RStudio.

My special thanks goes to YouTube channel freeCodeCamp.org vedio titled "R Programming Tutorial - Learn the Basics of Statistical Computing", as that is where I get my first vedio tutorial lession on R.
